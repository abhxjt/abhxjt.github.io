    <h1>Hey, the love of my life !</h1>
    <h2>I have got my peace and happiness in the form of you.</h2>
    <p>Starting from the day-1 when I started talking to you, I did feel something might happen<br>
    between us, but that was just a sense of feeling. But gradually we had so much of sharing<br>
    thoughts and things, I started to have a sense of attraction developed towards you. I could<br>
    not stop thinking about you, felt like talking to you always and have you as my comfort.<br>
    No matter what I thought about relationship stuffs then, but you had that charm that could<br>
    make think of giving it another try. I held my breath to decide off the things I'm gonna do<br>
    in the future with you. Moreover, I later found out, you too had something developed within<br>
    you against me. I could not further stop holding back my feelings for you, rather confessing<br>
    it before you.<br>
    And then one day, we met. God, I was so overwhelmed to discover the beauty and divine beyond<br>
    your sweet and comforting talks. It was a thursday, since I was born on a thursday, it may be<br>
    considered to be a good day to you, and guess what!! Thursdays bring you your love towards<br>
    you. The cuteness in your looks and elegance of your appearance had, seriously, blown me away<br>
    at that moment. We actually got to touch each other and I felt homely. I can never forget<br>
    the day we met.<br>
    We had so much of ups and downs, got through fights and misunderstandings and later one day<br>
    You officially decided to become the private property of Mr. Abhijeet Pradhan, oh yeah, that's<br>
    me. The efforts and trust you shown that day, had really made me decide that this ain't gonna<br>
    be one of that untrustable Abhijeet anymore. I finally decided to give you everything I can<br>
    and officially accept you as my soulmate.<br>
    I love you so much, Ms. Tanichha Bal. I can fight, get irritated, be non-understanding, but<br>
    I can never leave you. You are my heart. I feel everyday same as our first meet, same <br>
    butterflies in my stomach. Everyday I hope to have you permanently in my future and spend the<br>
    rest of my life with you.<br>
    <br>
    
    </p>
    <h2>I love you so much, sweetheart! I really want you and can do anything for it.</h2>
